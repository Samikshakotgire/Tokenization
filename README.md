# Tokenization 

This repository contains the tokenization assignment implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The assignment demonstrates the process of breaking down text into smaller, meaningful components such as words or subwords, which is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP).

## üìÑ File Description

- **`Chatgpt (1).ipynb`**: The notebook that implements the tokenization process with examples and explanations.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Introduction to Tokenization**  
  An overview of tokenization, its significance in NLP, and its applications.

- **Implementation**  
  The notebook includes:
  - Word tokenization
  - Sentence tokenization
  - Custom tokenization methods

- **Examples**  
  Real-world examples using Python libraries such as `nltk` and `spaCy`.

- **Use Cases**  
  Practical scenarios where tokenization can be applied:
  - Preprocessing text for machine learning models
  - Creating datasets for sentiment analysis or language modeling
  - Text data analysis in research tasks

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tokenization-Assignment.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Chatgpt (1).ipynb"
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook in sequential order.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries:
  - `nltk`
  - `spaCy`
